# The Izhikevich model

Remember the **mechanistic** [Hodgkin Huxley
model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%E2%80%93Huxley_model) in
all its glory with coupled differential equations?

Its great, but sometimes overkill if you don't want to model all the
detail of the Na and K channels.

A key simplification came from the **phenemonelogical** model by
[Izhikevich](https://www.izhikevich.org/publications/spikes.htm).

e.g. in this
[picture](https://www.izhikevich.org/human_brain_simulation/rssimple.gif),
one column is real data, one is from the model.  Which is which?

[This figure](https://www.izhikevich.org/publications/izhik.gif)
explains how the model is created.
